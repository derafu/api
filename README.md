## Ideas

- **Automatic Endpoint Discovery**: Detect and register API endpoints automatically based on registered services, controllers, routes, or annotations.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation**: Generate API documentation dynamically using annotations or conventions.
- **Framework-Agnostic Support**: Ensure compatibility with different PHP frameworks (Symfony, Laravel, etc.) or provide middleware-based integration.
- **Authentication and Security**: Support for JWT, OAuth, and API key-based authentication.
- **API Versioning**: Automatic detection and handling of API versions via URL, headers, or query parameters.
- **Interactive API Explorer**: Built-in web interface for testing API endpoints.
- **Middleware & Hooks**: Allow customization via middleware or event-driven hooks for request processing.
- - **Service Discovery Integration**: Optional registration with service discovery tools like Consul or Eureka.
